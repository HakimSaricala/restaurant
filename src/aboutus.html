                        business that would later be one of the “Best Filipino Restaurants”. 
                        With a forward-thinking mindset, the visionary Ceo Bill Gates realized a 
                        simple dream - the proliferation of an emerging business that showcases the 
                        best of Filipino cuisine.</p>

                    <p ><span>Bill Gates</span>  is currently the COO of Foodee Global Concepts and co-founder of 
                    Kraver’s Canteen, a trailblazing cloud kitchen concept in the Philippines. Today, 
                    the younger Gates has grown into the business as its COO, running things alongside his 
                    father.</p>

                <div class="about-content-1-text">
                    
                    <p class="content-text-sub">Having keenly identified the unfulfilled needs of the Filipino 
                        dining out market, Mr. Gates began with a concept that was truly ahead of its time. Inspired 
                        by the success of his other business ventures and armed with a deeper understanding of the 
                        local dining landscape, the seeds were soon quickly planted for the group's brainchild: MuRa 
                        in Greenbelt 5, Makati City which initially opened its doors to the dining public back in 2009. 
                        MuRa soon became a favorite stop to enjoy both classic Filipino dishes influenced by diverse 
                        regions in the Philippines with endearing modern twists. To be truly representative of Filipino 
                        cuisine throughout the country and across the globe, MuRa sought to be as inclusive as possible 
                        to pay homage to regional Filipino dishes. As a result, MuRa became a melting pot so to speak of 
                        authentic Filipino dishes given a modern reinvention which inexorably led to the now-beloved MuRa 
                        signature dishes.</p>

            <div class="about-content-3">
                <p>Due to the brand’s recognizable growth, MuRa received prominent awards 
                    like the <span>“Best Binakol in the Philippines”</span>, the <span>“Best Crispchon In The World”</span> 
                    from Taste Atlas and recognized as one of the <span>"Best Filipino Restaurants"</span> in the Philippines 
                    for twelve (12) consecutive years by Philippine Tatler and awarded by the Department of Trade 
                    and Industry in collaboration with Philippine Retailers Association as “Best Retailer of the Year”.

                    The <span>MuRa</span> threefold advantage can be summed up as innovative yet traditional cuisine, 
                    genuine Filipino hospitality, and an exceptional dining experience highlighted by native 
                    accents all within the realm of affordable luxury. Today, our food business venture operates 
                    more than <span>70 restaurants nationwide</span> while setting a keen eye toward the future of further expansion 
                    across the country and abroad while we march forward towards our unified goal - Our Road to <span>100
